 Step-1: Basic CSS Questions (8 questions)
-------------------------------------------


<!-- 1. What is CSS, and how does it work with HTML? (CSS কি, এবং কিভাবে HTML এর সাথে কাজ করে?) -->

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page.
1. Inline CSS is written inside an HTML tag with the style attribute. 
   Exmple: 
   <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a styled paragraph.</p>

2. Internal CSS is written inside a <style></style> element, which goes inside the <head> of the HTML document.
   Exmple: 
    <head>
        <style>
            p { color: blue; font-size: 16px; }
        </style>
    </head>

3. External CSS is written in a separate file called an external stylesheet, and linked to the HTML document with a <link> tag.
   Exmple: 
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>



<!-- 2. What is the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS? (ইনলাইন, অভ্যন্তরীণ এবং বহিরাগত CSS এর মধ্যে পার্থক্য কী?) -->

1. Inline CSS:
Inline CSS is used to apply styling directly within the HTML element itself using the ‘style’ attribute. This method is beneficial for making specific style changes to individual elements, but it can become cumbersome to maintain and reuse styles consistently across a website.

2. Internal CSS:
Internal CSS involves placing the CSS code within the <style></style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. This method allows for the consolidation of all styling rules in one place, making it easier to manage and maintain the styles across multiple pages within a site.

3. External CSS:
External CSS refers to storing the CSS code in a separate file with a .css extension and linking it to the HTML document using the <link> tag. This method promotes better organization and scalability by allowing the same styles to be applied across multiple pages on a website, enhancing consistency and ease of updates.



<!-- 3. Explain the CSS box model. What properties does it consist of? -->

The CSS box model is very important for understanding how elements are structured, styled, and spaced on a webpage. By understanding the box model, developers can create attractive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. According to the CSS box model, the web browser supplies each element as a square prism.

CSS box model properties:
• width and height: Control the dimensions of the content area.
• padding: Sets space between the content and the border, keeping the space inside the box.
• border: Defines the line around the padding and content.
• margin: Sets the space outside the border, creating space around the element.



<!-- 4. What is specificity in CSS, and how does it affect styling? (CSS-এর নির্দিষ্টতা কী এবং এটি কীভাবে স্টাইলিংকে প্রভাবিত করে?)-->

CSS specificity is a fundamental concept in CSS that determines the order in which styles are applied. This is calculated based on the type of selector used, including inline style, id, class, attribute, and element type. CSS specifications are important to understand:

• Avoid styling conflicts
• Ensure consistent design application
• Maintain control over CSS code

This knowledge is essential for you to create efficient, maintainable and scalable stylesheets that render their website or application as intended.

How specificity works:
1. Inline style: Added directly to an element using the style attribute, such as <div style="color: blue;">. Inline styles have the highest specificity.
2. id selector: style that targets an element by its id attribute, such as the # header. ID selectors are very specific because they uniquely identify elements.
3. Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors: These target elements are based on class names (eg .menu), attribute selectors (eg [type="text"]), or pseudo-classes (eg :hover). They are less specific than ID selectors but more specific than element selectors.
4. Element (type) and pseudo-element selector: This target element by type, such as p or h1, or with pseudo-elements, such as ::before or ::after. These selectors have the lowest specificity.



<!-- 5. How do CSS selectors work, and what are some common types of selectors? -->

A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements to select CSS property values ​​within the rules applied to them.

Some common types of selectors:

1. Element: Selects all elements of a specific type (e.g., all <p> or <h1> elements).
Exmple: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        p {
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="section1p">Highlighted text</p>
</body>
</html>

2. Id Selector (#): Targets an element with a specific id attribute. Each id should be unique within the document.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        #header {
            font-weight: bold;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="header">Header</h1>
</body>
</html>

3. Universal Selector (*): Targets all elements in the document.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        * {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="section1p">Highlighted text</p>
</body>
</html>

4. Class Selector (.): Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Can be used multiple times on the same page.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .section1p {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="section1p">Highlighted text</p>
</body>
</html>



<!-- 6. What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements? Give examples of each. -->

1. Pseudo-Classes: Pseudo-Classes in CSS selects the element and changes the state of the element based on the user interaction.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> 
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" 
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
         a:hover{
             color: red;
         }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
     <a href="">Click</a>
</body>
</html>

2. Pseudo-Elements: The Pseduo-Elements in CSS is a keyword that is used to style specific part of the element. Pseudo-elements target a specific part of an element’s content or structure. Pseudo-elements are denoted by a double colon (::) before the element they style.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> 
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" 
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
         p::first-letter {
            font-weight: 700;
            font-size: larger;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
     <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Corrupti, modi.</p>
</body>
</html>



<!-- 7. Explain the concept of inheritance in CSS. -->

In CSS, inheritance means that certain style properties set on a parent element are passed down to its child elements. Not all properties are inherited automatically. Some, like color and font-family, are inherited by default, while others need to be explicitly set to inherit using the inherit keyword.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        body {
          font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
          color: black;
        }
        h1 {
          font-size: 24px;
        }
        p {
          font-size: 16px;
        }
      </style>
</head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
    </body>
</html>

In this example, we've set a font family and color for the <body> element. These styles will automatically apply to all child elements inside the <body>, including <h1> and <p> tags. As a result, both the heading and the paragraph will use Courier New as the font and have a color of black.



<!-- 8. What is the "!important" rule in CSS, and when should you use it? -->

The !important rule in CSS makes a style the top priority, so it overrides any other styles for the same property on that element, no matter the order or specificity. Adding !important ensures that this style will be applied, even if other rules try to set a different style.
Exmple: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        p{
            color: red !important;
        }
        .section1p {
            color: yellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="section1p">Highlighted text</p>
</body>
</html>

In this example, all <p> elements will appear red, even if an element has class="section1p", because color: red is marked with !important.

When to Use !important :
    • To override third-party or inline styles you can’t easily control.
    • For urgent fixes that need an immediate solution.




-------------------------------------------------
Step-2: Mostly Used CSS Properties (7 questions)
-------------------------------------------------


<!-- 1. How does the `display` property work, and what are the different display values? -->

Display property in CSS controls how an element appears on a webpage. It decides how the element takes up space and how it interacts with other elements.

Display Values:
1. block: Takes up the full width and starts on a new line.
2. inline: Takes up only as much width as needed and doesn’t start on a new line.
3. inline-block: Looks like an inline element but can have width and height. It can sit next to other elements.
4. none: The element is not shown at all and takes up no space.
5. flex: Makes it easy to arrange child elements in a flexible way, allowing for responsive designs.
6. grid: Creates a layout with rows and columns, useful for complex designs.
7. table: Makes the element behave like a table.



<!-- 2. What is the `position` property, and how do different position values (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) behave? -->

Position property in CSS controls how an element is positioned on a webpage. Here are the main position values and how they behave:

1. static: This is the default setting. Elements are placed in the normal flow of the page, one after the other, without any special positioning.

2. relative: The element is positioned relative to where it would normally be in the flow. You can move it using top, right, bottom, or left, but it still takes up space in its original position.

3. absolute: Absolute position allows you to place an element exactly where you want it on the page.

4. fixed: The element is positioned relative to the browser window. It stays in the same place even when you scroll the page, like a sticky header.

5.  static: The element toggles between relative and fixed based on the scroll position. It acts like relative until you scroll to a certain point, then it becomes fixed.



<!-- 3. How do the padding, margin, and border properties work in CSS? -->

1. Padding: Padding property in CSS is used to create space inside an element, between the content and the side of the element. It can be applied to all sides of an element.

2. Margin: The margin property in CSS is used to create space outside an element. This space helps separate the element from other elements on the page. M You can set margins for all four sides of an element.

3. Border: The border property in CSS is used to create a line around an element, separating it from the surrounding content.



<!-- 4. Explain the `flex` property. How do flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis work? -->

The flex property helps to arrange items in a flexible way inside a container. It lets items grow, shrink, or stay a certain size when the container changes size. Flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis are the three parts of flex.

1. Flex-grow: This tells the item how much it can grow compared to other items. Exmple: If one item has flex-grow: 1 and another has flex-grow: 2, the second item will get more extra space when the container gets bigger.

2. Flex-shrink: This tells the item how much it can shrink if there isn’t enough space. Example: If all items have flex-shrink: 1, they will shrink equally. If one has flex-shrink: 2, it will shrink more than the others.

3. Flex-basis: This sets the starting size of the item before it grows or shrinks. Example: If you set flex-basis: 100px, the item will start at 100 pixels wide.




<!-- 5. What is the difference between width, min-width, and max-width? -->

1. width: This property sets the actual width of an element. It defines how wide the element will be.

2. min-width: This property sets the minimum width an element can be. It prevents the element from getting smaller than this value, even if there isn't enough space.

3. max-width: This property sets the maximum width an element can be. It prevents the element from getting wider than this value, even if there is extra space.



<!-- 6. How does the z-index property work, and when would you use it? -->

It controls which elements appear on top of others when they overlap. Think of it like layers of paper: elements with a higher z-index are on top of those with a lower value. To use z-index, the element must have a position. Use position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky. Give the element a z-index value. This can be any number (like 1, 2, 3), including negative numbers (like -1). Higher numbers are on top, Lower numbers are underneath.

If I want some elements to overlap, I use z-index to control which one is on top. For pop-ups or dropdown menus, I often use a high z-index to make sure they appear above other content. If I have text or buttons that should be on top of an image, I use z-index to make sure they don’t get hidden.



<!-- 7. What is the difference between the opacity and visibility properties? -->

The opacity property controls how see-through an element is. If I set it to 1, it’s fully visible. If I set it to 0, it’s completely invisible but still takes up space and can be clicked. Opacity is good when I want something to fade or look partly see-through.

The visibility property, on the other hand, controls whether an element is shown or hidden. When I set visibility: hidden, the element becomes invisible and can’t be clicked, but it still takes up space. I use visibility when I want something hidden but don’t want to move things around.



---------------------------------------------------
Step-3: CSS Layouts & Responsiveness (8 questions)
---------------------------------------------------


<!-- 1. What is the difference between `flexbox` and `CSS Grid`, and when should you use each? -->

Flexbox and CSS Grid are both CSS layout tools, but each is optimized for different layout needs. Flexbox is a one-dimensional system, designed to lay out items in a single direction—either as a row or a column. It works well for simpler layouts like aligning items within a navbar, footer, or card, where you need flexibility and control along a single axis. 

CSS Grid, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional layout system that enables you to manage layouts both vertically and horizontally. This makes it ideal for more complex, structured designs, such as full web pages, dashboards, or image galleries, where precise positioning of elements across multiple rows and columns is necessary. In general, Flexbox is best for straightforward alignment tasks, while CSS Grid is suited to complex, multi-directional layouts.

Use Flexbox when you need a simple, single-row or single-column layout that requires flexible alignment, such as navbars, lists, or centering items. On the other hand , Use CSS Grid when your layout is two-dimensional and involves both rows and columns, such as a full webpage or a dashboard with multiple sections.



<!-- 2. Explain how to create a responsive layout using media queries. -->

To create a responsive layout, I use media queries in CSS to adjust styles based on screen size, allowing the layout to adapt seamlessly across devices. Here’s how it works:

1. Start with Base Styles: First, I define styles for small screens, like mobile devices. This is often called a "mobile-first" approach, where I design the layout to fit smaller screens by default.

2. Add Media Queries for Larger Screens: I then add media queries to adjust the layout for larger screens, like tablets and desktops. For instance, I might change the layout direction to horizontal on larger screens and increase spacing or rearrange elements.

3. Customize Element Sizes and Layout: Within each media query, I can adjust the size and positioning of individual elements to make the layout more structured and balanced for larger screens. For example, cards that are full-width on mobile might be half-width on tablets and one-third width on desktops.

This approach allows the layout to automatically adapt as screen sizes change: on small screens, elements are stacked vertically, and on larger screens, they’re arranged side-by-side or in more complex grids. Media queries make it easy to create a responsive design that provides a smooth experience on any device.



<!-- 3. How do you create a centered element in CSS? Provide multiple ways. -->

In CSS, centering an element can be achieved in a few different ways, depending on whether the goal is horizontal, vertical, or full centering. For horizontal centering of block elements, I can set a specific width and apply margin: auto, which evenly spaces the element on either side within its container. To center elements both horizontally and vertically, Flexbox is a versatile option; I can use display: flex on the parent container along with justify-content: center for horizontal alignment and align-items: center for vertical alignment. CSS Grid is another effective method for full centering by using display: grid and place-items: center on the parent container. If I need precise centering, absolute positioning works well by setting top and left to 50% and using transform: translate(-50%, -50%) to shift the element back to the center. For inline elements like text or buttons, I can use text-align: center on the parent container to center them horizontally. Each of these approaches offers a flexible way to achieve centered layouts in different contexts.

Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .centered {
            width: 50%;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }

        .container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
        }
        .container {
            display: grid;
            place-items: center;
        }
        .centered {
            position: absolute;
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        }
        .container {
            text-align: center !important;
        }

    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="centered">Lorem ipsum</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>



<!-- 4. How does CSS Grid work, and what are `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`? -->

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS that enables you to create complex, two-dimensional grid layouts with rows and columns. It works by turning a container into a grid with specified rows and columns, allowing child elements to be placed precisely within the grid cells.

To use CSS Grid, apply display: grid to a container, which then allows you to define the structure of the grid using properties like grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns. These properties specify the number of rows and columns, as well as their size, giving you control over how content is organized.

1. grid-template-rows: Defines the number and size of rows in the grid. Each value in grid-template-rows represents the height of a row, which can be specified in pixels, percentages, fr units (fractional space), or other CSS units. Multiple values create multiple rows.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Document</title>
      <style>
            .grid-container {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-rows: 100px 200px auto;
            }
      </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div class="grid-container">
          <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
          <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
          <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
      </div>
  </body>
</html> 
Here, the grid will have three rows: the first is 100px high, the second is 200px, and the third automatically adjusts to fill the remaining space.

2. grid-template-columns: Defines the number and width of columns in the grid. Similar to grid-template-rows, it allows you to specify each column's width.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Document</title>
      <style>
      .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
        }

      </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div class="grid-container">
          <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
          <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
          <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
      </div>
  </body>
</html> 
In this example, the grid will have three columns: the first and third columns take up 1 fraction of the space each, while the middle column takes up 2 fractions.

Together, grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns allow you to structure your layout by controlling the number, size, and proportions of rows and columns, creating a flexible and organized grid system.



<!-- 5. How does the `flex-direction` property work in Flexbox, and what are its values? -->

The flex-direction property in Flexbox is used to define the direction in which flex items are placed in a flex container. It determines the main axis along which items are laid out, and consequently affects the alignment and order of the items.

Values of flex-direction:

1. row: This is the default value. It arranges flex items horizontally from left to right. The main axis is horizontal, and the cross axis is vertical.
2. row-reverse: Similar to row, but items are arranged horizontally from right to left. This effectively reverses the order of the items along the main axis.
3. column: This value arranges flex items vertically from top to bottom. The main axis is vertical, and the cross axis is horizontal.
4. column-reverse: Similar to column, but items are arranged vertically from bottom to top. This reverses the order of the items along the main axis.



<!-- 6. What is a viewport, and how do you make elements responsive to viewport changes? -->

The viewport is the visible area of a webpage on a device’s screen, which adjusts in size depending on the screen dimensions (e.g., on a phone, tablet, or desktop). When creating responsive designs, it’s essential to ensure elements adapt to changes in the viewport size, so they display well on all devices.

Making Elements Responsive to the Viewport:
To make elements responsive to the viewport, I can use specific units called viewport-based units: vw, vh, vmin, and vmax. The vw unit stands for "viewport width," and 1 vw equals 1% of the width of the screen. For example, if I set an element's width to 50vw, it will take up half of the screen's width. On the other hand, vh stands for "viewport height," and 1 vh equals 1% of the screen's height. If I set an element's height to 50vh, it will be half the height of the screen.

Additionally, vmin and vmax are helpful for making elements responsive to the smaller or larger size of the viewport. vmin uses the smaller dimension (either width or height), while vmax uses the larger dimension. For instance, if I set a font size to 5vmin, it will scale based on the smaller side of the screen. These viewport units allow elements to adjust automatically to different screen sizes, ensuring a fluid and user-friendly layout without needing media queries.



<!-- 7. How can you create a sticky footer that stays at the bottom of the page? -->
To create a sticky footer we have to use position: sticky, apply this property to the footer element in CSS. Set bottom: 0 to keep it at the bottom of its parent container, becoming fixed only when scrolling.
Exmple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sticky footer</title>
    <style>

        .footer {
            position: sticky;
            bottom: 0;
        }

    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>Header</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. At, deleniti.</p>
        </main>
        <footer class="footer">
           <p> footer </p>
        </footer>
      </div>      
</body>
</html>



<!-- 8. Explain how you would approach creating a mobile-first design. -->

1. Start Small: Design for mobile (320px width) first; add layout changes for larger screens with min-width media queries.

2. Focus on Essentials: Prioritize content and actions most important for mobile users. Keep it clean, focusing on a single-column layout.

3. Touch-Friendly Design: Ensure buttons and links are easy to tap, with a minimum size of 44px by 44px.

4. Optimize for Speed: Use small, responsive images and minimize assets to improve load times on mobile.

5. Real Device Testing: Test on actual mobile devices to catch issues with touch, scrolling, and responsiveness.

6. This approach ensures a streamlined design that grows gracefully for bigger screens.

<!-- 1. What do you understand by the universal sector? -->


In CSS, the universal selector (*) targets all elements in a document, making it useful for applying general, baseline styles. It's commonly used to reset default browser styles by setting properties like margin: 0, padding: 0, and box-sizing: border-box. This ensures consistency across elements and browsers. While powerful, it should be used with care, as it can impact performance if applied extensively in large or complex documents.



<!-- 2. What are CSS preprocessors, and how do they work? Give examples like SASS or LESS. -->

CSS preprocessors are tools that extend standard CSS with additional features, making it easier to write and manage styles. They allow developers to use variables (to store values like colors), nesting (to organize styles hierarchically), and mixins (to reuse styles across different selectors). Preprocessors, such as Sass and LESS, use their own syntax and compile into regular CSS that browsers can read. For example, in Sass, you can define a color variable and use it throughout your styles, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability. Overall, CSS preprocessors help create cleaner, more efficient code, making them valuable in modern web development.


<!-- 3. Explain CSS custom properties (CSS variables) and their benefits. -->

CSS custom properties, or CSS variables, are reusable values defined by the author that can be applied throughout a stylesheet. They are declared using the -- prefix and can be accessed with the var() function. For example, you might define a primary color like this:

:root {
    --primary-color: #3498db;
}

Then, use it in your styles:


body {
    color: var(--primary-color);
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
    :root {
        --primary-color: #3498db; 
        --font-size: 16px; 
    }

    p {
        font-size: var(--font-size);
        color: var(--primary-color);
    }

    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is an example of using CSS custom properties (variables).</p>
</body>
</html>

The benefits of CSS variables include improved reusability, easier maintenance (since you can change a value in one place), and the ability to dynamically update styles with JavaScript. They can also be scoped to specific selectors, making them flexible for theming. Overall, CSS custom properties make styling more efficient and adaptable.



<!-- 4. How do CSS animations work, and how can you create a keyframe animations? -->

CSS animations enable you to animate changes to CSS properties over time, creating dynamic effects without JavaScript. To create an animation, you define keyframes using the @keyframes rule, specifying the styles at different points in the animation. You then apply the animation to an element using the animation property. For instance, adding animation: slide-in 0.5s ease forwards; to a class will make that element slide in and fade in over half a second. This approach makes it easy to add engaging visual effects to your web pages. For example, you might create a keyframe animation that slides an element in from the left and fades it in:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        
        @keyframes slide-in {
            0% {
                transform: translateX(-100%); 
                opacity: 0; 
            }
            100% {
                transform: translateX(0); 
                opacity: 1; 
            }
        }
        
        .box {
            animation: slide-in 0.5s ease forwards; /* Apply the animation */
        }

    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box">Welcome!</div>
</body>
</html>



<!-- 5. What are CSS transitions, and how are they different from animations? -->

CSS transitions enable smooth changes between CSS property values when an element's state changes, like on hover. They are simple to implement, requiring only the properties to transition, along with a duration and timing function, without the need for keyframes. For example, you can change an element's background color on hover with a transition effect. In contrast, CSS animations involve more complex sequences that can include multiple keyframes, allowing for intricate animations beyond simple state changes. While transitions handle basic effects triggered by events, animations provide greater control and complexity for elaborate visual sequences.



<!-- 6. What is the difference between `rem`, `em`, and `px` units? -->

The units px, em, and rem are used in CSS for sizing elements, each with distinct behaviors. Pixels (px) are absolute units representing a fixed size on the screen, offering precise control but lacking scalability across different devices. em is a relative unit based on the font size of the current element or its parent, which can lead to compounded sizes in nested elements. For example, if an element's font size is set to 2em, it will be twice the size of its parent’s font size. rem, or "root em," is also a relative unit but is based solely on the font size of the root element (usually the <html>), ensuring consistent sizing throughout the document. For instance, setting an element’s font size to 2rem means it will always be twice the root font size, regardless of its parent. Using rem is often preferred for creating responsive designs, while em is useful for specific, nested contexts.



<!-- 7. What is SVG and how can it be used to create custom shapes? -->

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based format for creating two-dimensional vector graphics that can be scaled to any size without losing quality. It allows designers to create custom shapes using specific elements like <rect> for rectangles, <circle> for circles, and <path> for complex shapes. For example, you can define a blue rectangle, a red circle, and intricate designs using paths that specify points and curves. SVG graphics are easily styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript, making them versatile for web design. Overall, SVG is a powerful tool for producing high-quality, scalable graphics suitable for various applications on the web.
